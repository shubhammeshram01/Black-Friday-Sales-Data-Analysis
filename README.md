# Black-Friday-Sales-Data-Analysis

This dataset comprises sales transactions captured at a retail store. The dataset has 5,50,069 rows and 12 columns

## Analyze the dataset using the following Python libraries :
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## Analyze and Perform the following methods on the dataset :
1)  Create a new dataset having all the product-related columns
2)  Check the size, columns, data types
3)  Change the data type of "Purchase" to "float"
4)  Generate descriptive statistical values
5)  Get the percentage distribution of "Product_ID" available and the highest occurring product in the dataset
6)  Check missing values
7)  Handling missing values backward, forward filling
8)  Fetch the rows having the maximum purchase amount with complete row details

10)  Find the users who have been in the city 'A' for more than 4 years and purchase amounts of more than 10000
11)  Discard all the female users in city "B" with 3 years and purchase amount less than 1500
12)  Visualize everything with occupation value 10 and mask everything left
13)  Find which age group is more active in purchasing products from the website.
14)  Generate the list of user_id with the corresponding age and find the total count of purchases that have been done
15)  Find the total amount generated via the website by selling products
